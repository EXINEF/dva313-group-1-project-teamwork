Math functions for the TPMS system


Added two functions where TKPH is what is called to calculate the TKPH PER DAY and when array is 7 or above, it will update DB. 
The array tkph1 (excuse the name :P) is where we store tkph for each day. 
When function TKPH detects that the tkph1 has 7 elemets after the last element is inserted, it will add/update table in our DB
and clear the current array tkph (set it to null). 

Regarding the parameters, we can be flexible by only having velocity instead of l and h. 


NOTE:  This is per tyre.

    Here we calculate the real cite TKPH for one cycle. This will be multiplied by the coefficient k1 if the cycle lenght exceeds 5km 
    and k2 if the ambient temperature is below or above the referenced temperature of 38C. 

   Input:
    t = Ambient temperature. Should be gathered from the vehicle
    l = The lenght of a cycle
    h = The duration of a cycle

    qc = is the load per tyre in ton (TKPH) on a laden vehicle.
    qv = is the load per tyre in ton (TKPH) on an unladen vehicle
    Note: Assume Qv and Qc is given and the TKPH will be the same on each tire.

   k1 = the coeffecient give by the michelin document. This should be an array taken from a database where such values exists.

   Output:
    The calculated TKPH value for the current cycle.

   Note when calculating Qm for the future:
   "The Qm calculation should theoretically be made for
    each tyre. However, in practice, specifi c tyre loads are not
    normally available; therefore, this leads to the assumption
    that each tyre on the same axle carries an equal load.
    When calculating the average load per tyre on the front
    and the rear axles, the greatest value of Qm shall be used
    in TKPH (TMPH) calculation."

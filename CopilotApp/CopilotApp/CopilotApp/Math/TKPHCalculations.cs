            and k2 if the ambient temperature is below or above the referenced temperature of 38C. 

           Input:
            t = Ambient temperature. Should be gathered from the vehicle
            l = The lenght of a cycle
            h = The duration of a cycle

            qc = is the load per tyre in ton (TKPH) on a laden vehicle.
            qv = is the load per tyre in ton (TKPH) on an unladen vehicle
            Note: Assume Qv and Qc is given and the TKPH will be the same on each tire.

           k1 = the coeffecient give by the michelin document. This should be an array taken from a database where such values exists.

           Output:
            The calculated TKPH value for the current cycle.

        Here we calculate the real cite TKPH for one cycle. This will be multiplied by the coefficient k1 if the cycle lenght exceeds 5km 
        and k2 if the ambient temperature is below or above the referenced temperature of 38C. 

       Input:
        t = Ambient temperature. Should be gathered from the vehicle
        l = The lenght of a cycle
        h = The duration of a cycle

        qc = is the load per tyre in ton (TKPH) on a laden vehicle.
        qv = is the load per tyre in ton (TKPH) on an unladen vehicle
        Note: Assume Qv and Qc is given and the TKPH will be the same on each tire.

       k1 = the coeffecient give by the michelin document. This should be an array taken from a database where such values exists.

       Output:
        The calculated TKPH value for the current cycle.

       Note when calculating Qm for the future:
       "The Qm calculation should theoretically be made for
        each tyre. However, in practice, specifi c tyre loads are not
        normally available; therefore, this leads to the assumption
        that each tyre on the same axle carries an equal load.
        When calculating the average load per tyre on the front
        and the rear axles, the greatest value of Qm shall be used
        in TKPH (TMPH) calculation."
